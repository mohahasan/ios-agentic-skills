# Marketing Copywriting

Use this skill when writing marketing copy for your app: social posts, website text, app store descriptions, emails, or any user-facing content.

## Core Principles

### 1. Benefits Before Features

**Wrong:** "The app uses Core Haptics to send patterns." (Feature)
**Right:** "Feel exactly when to switch tasks without looking." (Benefit)

Always answer: **What does the user GET?** Not what does the app DO.

| Feature (What it does) | Benefit (What user gets) |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| iCloud Sync | Start on iPhone, finish on Mac |
| Haptic Feedback | Know what's happening without looking |
| Offline Mode | Works wherever you are, no signal needed |
| 120Hz Support | Butter-smooth scrolling |

### 2. Less Words = More Impact

Cut ruthlessly. If a word doesn't add meaning, delete it.

**Wordy:** "This application is designed to help you organize your daily tasks more efficiently."
**Concise:** "Organize your day. Get more done."

**Rule:** After writing, ask "Can I cut 30%?" Usually yes.

### 3. Find Your "Anchor" Word

Every great app has an anchor concept. Find yours and stick to it.

**Examples:**
- **Haptix (Timer App):** "Feel" ("Timing you can feel")
- **Headspace:** "Mindful"
- **Obsidian:** "Second Brain"

Avoid generic words like "manage," "track," or "view." Use sensory or emotional words.

### 4. Pain → Solution → Outcome

Structure all copy this way:

1. **Pain:** "Ever lose your train of thought checking the clock?"
2. **Solution:** "Our app taps your wrist at key moments."
3. **Outcome:** "You stay present. Time handles itself."

### 5. You, Not We

Write to the user, not about yourself.

**Wrong:** "We built this to solve our presentation problems."
**Right:** "Never break eye contact to check the time again."

## Brand Voice Template

Define your app's voice. Pick 3-4 adjectives:

| Attribute | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Confident** | "The last timer you'll need" |
| **Warm** | "Built for people who hate checking clocks" |
| **Concise** | Short sentences. Fragments okay. |
| **Real** | No corporate speak. Write like a person. |

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Reddit
- **Tone:** Casual, authentic, "maker" vibe.
- **Hook:** Lead with a personal story or a specific problem you solved.
- **Engagement:** "Roast my UI" or "I built this because X sucked" works better than "Check out my app."
- **Transparency:** Be open about pricing and features.

### LinkedIn
- **Tone:** Professional but personal.
- **Hook:** "I built something to solve [Professional Problem]."
- **Focus:** Productivity, career growth, technical achievement.

### App Store
- **First Line:** Must be your strongest benefit hook.
- **Format:** Short paragraphs, bullet points for features.
- **Keywords:** Integrate naturally, don't stuff.

### Slack/Email
- **Tone:** Super concise.
- **CTA:** One clear Call to Action.
- **Format:** Use bullet points.

## Quick Checklist

Before publishing any copy, ask:

- [ ] Does it lead with a benefit, not a feature?
- [ ] Can I cut 30% of the words?
- [ ] Do I use "You" more than "I" or "We"?
- [ ] Is the outcome clear to the user?
- [ ] Would I stop scrolling to read this?

## Case Study: "Haptix" (Timer App)

Here is how these principles were applied to a real app.

### Bad → Good Examples

**Bad (Feature-focused):**
"Haptix is a segmented timer application for iOS and watchOS that provides customizable haptic feedback notifications."

**Good (Benefit-focused):**
"Feel your timing. Never check the clock again."

---

**Bad (Wordy):**
"Create custom timers with multiple segments and receive haptic notifications on your Apple Watch."

**Good (Concise):**
"Set your segments. Your wrist handles the rest."

---

**Bad (Self-centered):**
"We worked hard to make the sync seamless."

**Good (User-centered):**
"Start on your phone. Feel it on your wrist."
