# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, use GitHub’s private Security Advisory feature:
- Navigate to the repo
- Go to the Security tab
- Click “Advisories” → “Report a vulnerability”

We will respond as quickly as possible.
